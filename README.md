## Project description:
### Visualize an earthquake data set from USGS http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

### Tools used:
* D3 library to read JSON file.
* Leaflet JavaScript library to build interactive Maps.

### Leaflet-Step-1
* Plots all of the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earthquake by color.
* Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* A legend that provide context for map data.

### Leaflet-Step-2
* Plots a second data set on a map additional to earchquakes to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
* Data on tectonic plates was taken from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
* A number of base maps to choose from, two different data sets separated into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.
